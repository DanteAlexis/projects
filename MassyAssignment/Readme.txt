The Flickr app is the 'massyTech' folder
Open a shell, navigate to the folder and type 'docker-compose build' and then 'docker-compose up'.
The app is hosted on localhost:80

Improvements for version 2.0 ;)
	Flickr's feed only provides about twenty images. I will create a JS function to pull more images depending on the position of the scroll bar.
	Re-architecting the app so that the search microservices only provide text information and not HTML. Instead HTML will be generated by web-service which will store all image information even accross requests (as it's a one page app). This way, old images can persist even beyond sorting, and it will be easier to sort images in connection to Improvement No.1 above.(would have done this initially but was still finding my legs with Docker)
	Make it more responsive. It works for desktops and tablets, but gets a little weird on phone if an image has a long name.
	Make image details more visually appealing :)
	Centre images horizontally and vertically in their containers.
	
Also, My card kept declining to allow Amazon access for now. So no live site :(
